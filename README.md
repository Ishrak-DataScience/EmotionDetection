# Emotion Detection Project

This repository contains the code, models, and datasets for an **Emotion Detection** task. The project aims to classify emotions from text data using machine learning and deep learning models.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **`Experimental_Models/`** - Contains different models and experiments for emotion detection.
  - **`Models_used_in_plotting/`** - Includes models that were used for generating plots. The `SelectedModel.py` script can be used to re-generate these plots.Replace SelectedModel with the name of the python files for plotting.
  - **`Experimental_Models/Other_experimental_models/`** directory contains various smaller experimental models upon which the 'Models_used_in_plotting' is built on. 
- **`plots/`** - Visualizations and performance analysis plots.
- **`prediction/`** - Scripts and files related to emotion predictions.
- **`public_data/`** - Publicly available datasets for training and evaluation.
- **`public_data_test/`** - Test datasets used for evaluation.
- **CSV Files (`.csv`)** - Datasets used for training and testing.
- **`nohup.out`** - Log file capturing execution outputs.

## Clone the repository:
